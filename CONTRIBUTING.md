# Welcome to the Hîsyêô community's dictionary project, yôn Gicîdolû

Thank you for helping us build this critical resource for the language's development!

Because Hîsyêô is minimalist, we don't just translate words, we translate **concepts**. We rely on community contributions to find the best compound expressions to navigate the complexity of English terms.

Please read these guidelines to ensure your contributions are accepted and useful to others.

## 1. The Golden Rule: Search Before You Submit

Before adding a new entry, please use the search bar in the tool.

* **Check the Base Form (Lemma):** Do not add conjugated forms like "running," "played," or "mice." Only search for and add the base form: "run," "play," or "mouse." If everything works as it's intended, the related search functionality should include the right related terms if a user searches for a non-base form.
* **Check the Meaning:** If the word exists, read the definition carefully. Does the existing entry cover the exact concept you want to add? If yes, **do not add it again.**

## 2. Handling Polysemy (Multiple Meanings)

**You *should* submit a duplicate English word if it represents a completely different meaning.**

English words are extremely polysemous (they have many meanings). In our minimalist language, different meanings usually require different translations.

> **Example: "Bank"**
> * **Entry 1:** *Bank* (Noun) — An organization that provides financial services.
> * **Entry 2:** *Bank* (Noun) — Sloping land along the side of a river.
> * **Entry 3:** *Bank* (Verb) — To tilt an aircraft to the side.

**The Rule:** You may add a word that is already in the dictionary, provided the **Part of Speech** or the **Definition** makes it clearly distinct from existing entries.

## 3. Writing the Description

The tool requires you to define the English term. We aim for maximum simplicity here to help users understand the core concept.

* **Use a Simplified Dictionary:** We highly recommend using the [Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE)](https://www.ldoceonline.com/) or a similar learner's dictionary.
* **Why?** These dictionaries use a limited vocabulary to define words. If you use their definitions, it is much easier for others to understand exactly which concept you are translating.

## 4. Providing Translations

When inputting the conlang translation:

* **Be Creative:** Use established community phrases or intuitive logical compounds.
* **Do Not "Reshuffle":** Do not add a new entry if you are simply rearranging the word order of an existing translation.
    * *Bad Example:* If "water red" exists, do not submit a new entry for "red water."
    * **Why?** Our duplicate checker looks for exact string matches. It cannot tell that you have simply swapped words. This creates clutter. Please respect the maintainers' time by ensuring your translation is a genuinely new construction.

## 5. Using the Submission Tool

You could fork this repository and build submission JSON files directly, but our website handles all of that work for you, just ensure the data you input is accurate.

1.  **Part of Speech (Required):** The tool will force you to select a Part of Speech (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.). Ensure this matches the definition you are providing.
    * *Note:* "Park" (the place) is a **Noun**. "Park" (the car) is a **Verb**.
2.  **Definition:** Paste or write your simplified definition (LDOCE recommended).
3.  **Submit & Fork:** Any submission items will get added to a submission JSON file and you will be directed to commit your submission to your fork
4.  **Pull Request:** After creating your fork, you will then be asked to generate a pull request. Feel free to add any justification for your additions in the Pull Request description.
5.  **Review:** After PR submission, a moderator for the project will review your additions and reach out to you using the user ID you provided to confirm the validity of your additions.

**Note:** Translations can be added before submission for any newly submitted terms by going to the **Untranslated** page.

Thank you for helping us build the greatest minimalist language there ever was!
